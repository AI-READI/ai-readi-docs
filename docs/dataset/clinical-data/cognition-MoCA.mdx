## Overview of Data Domain

### Montreal CogniÍtive Assessment (MoCA)

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) is widely used as a screening tool to assess cognitive function. This validated method comprises diverse tasks targeting distinct cognitive domains, rendering it highly sensitive in detecting mild cognitive impairment. During assesment, subjects engage in tasks such as recalling word lists, drawing specific shapes, and following complex instructions. These tasks are all administered electronically using an iPad, with a maximum score of 30 points. A score below 24 indicates cognitive impairment, while a final total score of 26 and above is considered normal. Additionally, participants with 12 or fewer years of education are granted an additional point, thereby adjusting the results for varying education levels.

### MOCA assess

- Short-term memory
- Visuospatial abilities
- Executive functions
- Attention, concentration, and working memory
- Language
- Orientation to time and place

Since individuals with type 2 diabetes are at a higher risk of developing cognitive impairments, MOCA plays a crucial role in helping researchers understand the relationship between Type 2 diabetes and cognitive health. For the AI-READI project, the study data is captured on the MoCAtest Duo App (on tablet) and is administered by trained Clinical Research Coordinators. The data is available in .csv format.
Some limitations of the MoCA include the need for trained professionals to accurately score it, the potential influence of a person's education level and fluency in English on test outcomes, the impact of socioeconomic factors, and the similarity in scores between individuals with depression or other mental health issues and those with mild dementia.

## Data Processing

### File format

The MoCA data from all subjects is stored in a .csv file, along with other RedCap measurements. A .csv file, short for Comma-Separated Values, is a commonly used file format for storing tabular data in plain text, where each line represents a row of data and each value within the row is separated by a comma.

The file organization is as follows:

```
pilot_data_root
└── clinical_data
    └── measurement.csv
```

| Domain    | Variable                             | Method                      | Data Standard/ File Extension | Open Source vs. Protected Database? |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Cognition | Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) | on tablet; MoCAtest Duo App | .csv                          | Open Source                         |

### Data Standards

MoCA data follows the OMOP Common Data Model. [OMOP](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/) (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) is a collaborative effort focused on standardizing and analyzing healthcare data. Developed by the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community, OMOP provides a standardized data model, vocabulary, and analytics tools to enable large-scale analysis of real-world healthcare data.

### File Processing

The .csv files are designed for easy opening in Python and/or Jupyter Notebooks. The MoCA data is organized per subject (person_id) and within each subject block i.e. ~30 rows, each row corresponds to a different measurement type (measurement_concept_id) for that subject.
