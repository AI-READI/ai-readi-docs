## Overview of Data Domain

Vision assessment serves as a crucial indicator of retinal health in individuals with Type 2 diabetes. Prolonged exposure to high blood sugar levels, known as hyperglycemia, can lead to various complications within the eye, particularly affecting the delicate structures of the retina. As a result, individuals with diabetes are at an increased risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, a progressive eye disease that can result in vision impairment and, if left untreated, blindness. Besides this, fluctuation in blood glucose levels can lead to significant shifts in the refractive power, resulting in rapid changes in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. Therefore, assessing vision is essential in diabetes management, as it provides valuable insights into the health of the retina and enables timely intervention to prevent or mitigate the progression of diabetic eye complications.

In this study, vision is assessed using autorefraction, best corrected visual acuity and contrast sensitivity and below is a brief description of the measurement.
