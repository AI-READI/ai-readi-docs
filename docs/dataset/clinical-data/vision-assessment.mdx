title: Vision Assessment
---

## Overview of Data Domain

Vision assessment serves as a crucial indicator of retinal health in individuals with Type 2 diabetes. Prolonged exposure to high blood sugar levels, known as hyperglycemia, can lead to various complications within the eye, particularly affecting the delicate structures of the retina. As a result, individuals with diabetes are at an increased risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, a progressive eye disease that can result in vision impairment and, if left untreated, blindness. Besides this, fluctuation in blood glucose levels can lead to significant shifts in the refractive power, resulting in rapid changes in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. Therefore, assessing vision is essential in diabetes management, as it provides valuable insights into the health of the retina and enables timely intervention to prevent or mitigate the progression of diabetic eye complications.

In this study, vision is assessed using autorefraction, best corrected visual acuity and contrast sensitivity and below is a brief description of the measurement.

## Variables included in Data Domain

### Autorefraction

Autorefraction is a non-invasive diagnostic test used during routine clinical examinations to measure an individual's refractive error. During the test, an automated instrument (**Topcon KR 800**) measures how light is focused on the back of the eye. Based on the size and shape of the reflections, the autorefractor automatically adjusts to achieve the correct focus, quantifying the eye's power in diopters. This measurement includes spherical and cylindrical corrections, along with the axis, for both the right and left eyes. Spherical value refers to the overall power of the eyeglass prescription, correcting nearsightedness or farsightedness. "Cylinder" and "axis" relate to astigmatism, a condition where the eye is shaped more like a football than a perfect sphere. The "cylinder" measures the degree of astigmatism, and the "axis" identifies its orientation.

Limitations: When considering autorefraction, it's important to keep in mind potential inaccuracies in measuring refractive errors, particularly in individuals with specific eye conditions or irregularities like cataracts or corneal abnormalities. Additionally, autorefraction may not offer as precise results as subjective refraction, which relies on patient feedback for determining the best corrective lenses.

All data were entered into a RedCap form titled BCVA, which is available in our full list of data instruments [here](https://docs.aireadi.org/files/REDCap%20surveys%20and%20forms.pdf).

### Best Corrected Visual Acuity

Best Corrected Visual acuity refers to the sharpest, clearest vision an individual can achieve with the best possible correction, i.e. using glasses or contact lenses. This measurement is important for assessing the overall quality of vision and is commonly used in eye examinations and vision assessments. Additionally, photopic and mesopic visual acuity testing is essential for assessing vision under different lighting conditions. Photopic conditions mimic bright, well-lit settings similar to daytime conditions, allowing for the evaluation of vision in optimal lighting. On the other hand, mesopic conditions simulate low-light environments, such as dusk or dimly lit rooms, which are common in everyday scenarios. By testing visual acuity in both photopic and mesopic conditions, healthcare professionals can assess how well individuals can see in different lighting situations, which is crucial for activities like driving at night or navigating dimly lit areas safely.

The **M&S Technologies EVA** system is used to conduct BCVA tests under both Photopic and Mesopic conditions. The chart exclusively features letters, each bracketed by lines on all sides. During testing, subjects are prompted to read these letters displayed on a 12x20-inch touch screen monitor which is positioned 4 feet away, while wearing their own prescription spectacles or trial frames. All tests are conducted without dilation.

**Photopic conditions**: A general occluder is used to test under monocular right eye and left eye conditions respectively. For example, the occluder is placed on the left eye to assess the right eye.

**Mesopic conditions**: A neutral density filter is used to test under monocular right eye and left eye conditions respectively. For example, the neutral density filter is placed on the left eye to assess the left eye.

All data were entered into RedCap under BCVA, which is available in our full list of data instruments [here](https://docs.aireadi.org/files/REDCap%20surveys%20and%20forms.pdf).

Limitations: A caveat of Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) testing is that it primarily evaluates central vision sharpness and may not account for other critical aspects of visual function, including contrast sensitivity, depth perception, or peripheral vision. Consequently, BCVA may not provide a comprehensive assessment of overall visual abilities and functional vision. Additionally, BCVA testing might not detect subtle changes in vision that could affect daily activities, particularly in scenarios involving contrast or glare sensitivity.

### Mars Letter Contrast Sensitivity

Contrast sensitivity testing is a type of vision test that measures a person's ability to distinguish between light and dark contrasts, rather than simply testing visual acuity or sharpness. Photopic and mesopic contrast sensitivity testing evaluates how well an individual can see objects under varying lighting conditions and contrasts, which is important for tasks such as driving at night or reading in low-light environments. During testing, photopic conditions replicate well-lit environments, akin to daylight conditions, while mesopic conditions simulate low-light settings, such as twilight or dimly lit rooms.

The **MARS Letter Contrast Sensitivity test (Perceptrix)** is a standardized test used for contrast sensitivity testing under both Photopic and Mesopic conditions. It consists of rows of letters with varying contrast levels, and subjects are instructed to read them left to right across each line on the chart. Testing is terminated either when the subject makes two consecutive errors or reaches the end of the chart. The log contrast sensitivity (log CS) values are recorded by subtracting 0.04 times the number of errors before the final correct letter from the log CS value at the final correct letter. If no consecutive errors are made, the last correctly identified letter is recorded. All testing is performed with appropriate near correction, i.e., reading glasses or trial frames with +2.00D lenses under undilated conditions.

**Photopic conditions**: A general occluder is used to test under monocular right eye and left eye conditions respectively. For example, the occluder is placed on the left eye to assess the right eye.

**Mesopic conditions**: A neutral density occluder along with a low luminance filter lens is used to test under monocular right eye and left eye conditions respectively. For example, the neutral density occluder and low illuminance filter lens is placed on the left eye to assess the left eye.

All data were entered into RedCap under Photopic MARS or Mesopic MARS, which is available in our full list of data instruments here.

Limitations of contrast sensitivity testing include its sensitivity to environmental factors like lighting conditions and potential biases introduced by the testing environment. Additionally, individual factors such as age, cognitive ability, and eye health can influence test results, impacting the accuracy and reliability of the assessment.
