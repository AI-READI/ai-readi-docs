## Overview of Data Domain


Retinal photography is a non-invasive procedure that photographs the posterior segment of an eye, also known as the fundus. It provides two- dimensional images of the fundus and can be performed with different filters of different wavelengths when an eye is undilated or dilated. The main structures that can be visualized inon a fundus photo are the optic nerve, macula, retinal vasculature, and central and peripheral retina. Fundus photography is used to record the condition of these structures to document the presence of abnormalities and monitor the changes over time.
