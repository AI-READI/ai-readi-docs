# FAIR Principles

The [FAIR Principles](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) published in 2016 are considered the gold standard when it comes to making data optimally reusable by humans and machines such as AI/ML models. They have been widely promoted and adopted in all fields of research worldwide by all stakeholders including research communities, scientific publishers, and funders. We believe that for data to be AI-ready, it needs to align with the FAIR Principles. We provide below an assessment of how this version of the AI-READI dataset is FAIR, i.e. complies with each of the FAIR Principles.

    <td className="align-top">
      F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier.
    </td>
    <td className="align-top">
      This principle can be fulfilled by sharing data and metadata on a repository that
      provides a digital object identifier (DOI) or another similar globally unique and
      persistent identifier for your dataset. Globally unique here means that the
      identifier is guaranteed to unambiguously refer to exactly one resource in the
      world. Persistent means never reused in another context, and continues to identify
      the same resource, even if that resource no longer exists, or moves.
    </td>
    <td className="align-top">
      The AI-READI dataset is shared on fairhub.io, which provides a DOI for the dataset
        ([https://doi.org/10.60775/fairhub.2](https://doi.org/10.60775/fairhub.2))
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td className="align-top">
      F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below).
    </td>
    <td className="align-top">
      While other principles speak to the specific kinds of metadata that should be
      included, principle F2 simply says that a digital resource that is not
      well-described cannot be accurately discovered. Thus, this principle encourages data
      providers to consider the various facets of search that might be employed by a user
      of their data, and to support those users in their discovery of the resource. This
      principle can be fulfilled by sharing data in a repository that requires metadata.
      Including metadata directly in the data files (automatically or manually) can also
      help fulfill this principle. Additionally, including standalone metadata files
      (along with your data files) can help with fulfilling this principle as well.
    </td>
    <td className="align-top">
      <p>
        Data files in the AI-READI dataset have embedded metadata in them (e.g., headers
        in the DICOM files). This is described for each data type in the dataset
        documentation at <a href="http://docs.aireadi.org">docs.aireadi.org</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the AI-READI dataset is structured according to the Clinical Dataset
        Structure (CDS), which prescribes to include several metadata files (README.md,
        Healthsheet.md, dataset_description.json, etc.). More details are available in the
        CDS specification documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the AI-READI dataset is shared on fairhub.io, where metadata from the
        CDS-prescribed metadata files is embedded in the dataset's landing page following
        the schema.org schema to enable discovery through search engines

      F.3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they
      describe.
    </td>
    <td className="align-top">
      Sharing data on a suitable repository that issues a DOI (F1) will typically fulfill
      this principle since the DOI will typically be embedded in the metadata stored by
      the repository. Additionally, the DOI can also be included in any of the metadata
      files that are included along with the data files (F2)
    </td>
    <td className="align-top">
      The DOI of the AI-READI dataset is included in the various metadata files prescribed
      by the CDS. The DOI is also included in the metadata embedded in the landing page of
      the dataset.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td className="align-top">F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource. </td>
    <td className="align-top">
      This principle can be fulfilled by sharing data on a repository that requires
      metadata (F2) and indexes that metadata such that it is searchable. It is suitable
      to consult what schema/format the repository follows to make the data discoverable
      locally (within the repository's search feature) and globally (e.g. in Google
      search)
    </td>
    <td className="align-top">
      The AI-READI dataset is shared through FAIRhub, which embes the dataset metadata in
      the landing page of the dataset using the schema.org schema and it is therefore
      searchable globally in search engines. The dataset is also searchable within FAIRhub
      itself.

      A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available
    </td>
    <td className="align-top">
      <p>
        This principle is automatically fulfilled if the dataset is shared on a repository
        issuing a DOI since getting a DOI requires registering the metadata with a DOI
        issuing organization (e.g., Datacite, Crossref) and the metadata theoretically
        remains always accessible through that organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, sharing data and metadata on a repository that keeps the metadata
        accessible even if data is not available (for any reason) can also help fulfill
        this principle
      </p>
    </td>
    <td className="align-top">
      The AI-READI dataset is shared on FAIRhub which registers a DOI for the dataset by
      sending major metadata from elements of the dataset to DataCite. This metadata will
      always remain accessible through DataCite's registry even if the dataset itself
      is no longer available for some reason on FAIRhub.

      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, if metadata is provided in standalone files, ensure that they are in

        The data files in the AI-READI dataset are in formal, accessible, shared and

      persistent identifier. Ontologies defined in the “Web Ontology Language” (OWL) and
      shared via a publicly accessible registry (e.g. BioPortal for life science
      ontologies) are examples of formally represented, accessible, mapped, and shared
      knowledge representations in a broadly applicable language for knowledge
      representation, that are also compliant with the Findability requirements of FAIR,
      since BioPortal provides a machine-accessible search interface.

      - Mention any particularities or limitations about the data that other users should
          be aware of.

      - Ensure that all variable names are explained or self-explanatory (i.e., defined in
