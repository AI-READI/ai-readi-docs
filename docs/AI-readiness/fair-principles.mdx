# FAIR Principles

The [FAIR Principles](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) published in 2016 are considered the gold standard when it comes to making data optimally reusable by humans and machines such as AI/ML models. They have been widely promoted and adopted in all fields of research worldwide by all stakeholders including research communities, scientific publishers, and funders. We believe that for data to be AI-ready, it needs to align with the FAIR Principles. We provide below an assessment of how this version of the AI-READI dataset is FAIR, i.e. complies with each of the FAIR Principles.
