## Mini version of the dataset

Since the AI-READI dataset is now quite large, we have created a mini version on popular demand that users can download first to explore the dataset and set up their pipelines.
This subset dataset contains data from 100 participants and is 179.68 GB in size. You can access the mini dataset and learn more about it [here](https://doi.org/10.60775/fairhub.4).
