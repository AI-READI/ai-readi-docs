Due to the size of the AI-READI dataset, we require requestors to provide an Azure storage container to receive the processed data. Specifically, at the end of the request process you will need to provide:

1. Storage Account Name
1. Blob Container Name
1. Blob SAS Token (with "Write" permission only)

Follow the steps over the next few pages to create your Azure storage environment. Please do this before you attempt to request the AI-READI dataset as it can lead to delays in processing your request.
