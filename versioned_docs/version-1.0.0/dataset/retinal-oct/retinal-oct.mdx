# Retinal Optical Coherence Tomography

## Overview of Data Domain

### General Information

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive diagnostic technique that renders an in vivo cross-sectional view of the retina. OCT utilizes a concept known as interferometry to create a cross-sectional map of the retina that is accurate to within at least 10-15 microns. This technique provides detailed, cross-sectional images of the various layers of the retina with high resolution, enabling clinicians to diagnose and monitor a wide range of retinal diseases and conditions.

How OCT of the retina works and its significance:

1. **Imaging Process**: OCT of the retina utilizes a low-coherence light source, usually near-infrared light, to capture cross-sectional images of the retina. The light is split into two arms, with one directed towards the retina (sample arm) and the other towards a reference mirror. The reflected light from both arms is then recombined and analyzed to generate an interference pattern.

2. **The retina consists of several layers**, including: internal limiting membrane, the retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer, inner plexiform layer, inner nuclear layer, outer plexiform layer, outer nuclear layer, external limiting membrane, photoreceptor layer (containing rods and cones), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and Bruch's membrane. OCT of the retina provides detailed visualization of these layers, allowing clinicians to assess their thickness, integrity, and any abnormalities. Choriocapillaris and choroidal stroma are also visible layers in OCT.

1. **Diagnosis and Monitoring**: OCT of the retina is widely used in ophthalmology for diagnosing identify structural changes in the retina, such as fluid accumulation, and monitoring various retinal conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, macular edema, and glaucoma.

2. **Treatment Guidance**: OCT of the retina plays a crucial role in guiding treatment decisions for retinal diseases. For example, it helps ophthalmologists determine the need for interventions such as intravitreal injections, laser therapy, or surgical procedures. By monitoring changes in retinal morphology over time, clinicians can assess the efficacy of treatment and adjust management strategies accordingly.

3. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) plays a crucial role in the detection and management of **glaucoma**, a progressive optic nerve disease characterized by damage to the optic nerve and loss of peripheral vision. OCT provides detailed, quantitative assessments of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and the optic nerve head (ONH), aiding in the early diagnosis, monitoring, and management of glaucoma.

   - **RNFL Thickness Measurement**: OCT allows for precise measurement of
     the thickness of the RNFL, which consists of axons of retinal ganglion cells.
     Thinning of the RNFL is a hallmark sign of glaucoma and can occur before visual
     field defects are detectable by conventional perimetry. OCT enables clinicians to
     quantitatively assess RNFL thickness around the optic nerve head and along the
     peripapillary region, helping in early detection of glaucoma and monitoring
     disease progression over time.

   - **Optic Nerve Head Assessment**: OCT provides detailed imaging of the
     optic nerve head, including measurements of rim area , cup-to-disc ratio, and
     neuroretinal rim thickness. Changes in these parameters can indicate structural
     damage to the optic nerve associated with glaucoma. OCT scans also allow
     clinicians to visualize and quantify the presence of optic disc hemorrhages, which
     are often associated with glaucomatous optic nerve damage.

A radial line-scan pattern is part of the ONH-RC scan protocol and allows for
assessing the thickness of the neuro-retinal rim based on the detection of the disk
margin. From each B-Scan, the shortest distance from Bruch's membrane opening (BMO) to
the ILM is determined and indicated by a cyan arrow in the B-Scan. The analysis is
therefore called BMO-based minimum rim width (BMO-MRW). It considers the variable
geometry of the neural tissue as it exits the eye via the optic nerve head. BMO-MRW
data can be classified based on a reference database according to Garway-Heath sectors
as well as globally.

## Data Processing

### File format

The file format is in [DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM) which is a technical standard for the digital storage and transmission of medical images and related information.

### Data Standard

For all files in retinal_photography, the exported files from the devices were formatted according to the NEMA DICOM standards on [Ophthalmic Tomography Image](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part03.html#sect_A.52). The detailed information about the tags and values could be found in the hyperlink.
All mandatory modules (M) were included, and within the mandatory modules, the tags that are categorized as [Type 1](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part05/sect_7.4.html#:~:text=The%20Data%20Element%20Type%20of,only%20mandatory%20under%20certain%20conditions) (Tag and value both needed) and [Type 2](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part05/sect_7.4.3.html) (tag needed value can be empty) were evaluated and filled in accordingly.

### File Processing

Files were processed to comply with the NEMA DICOM standards on [Ophthalmic Tomography Image](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part03.html#sect_A.52) through removing, adding, editing tags and values.
Note that tags that are not listed in [Ophthalmic Tomography Image](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part03.html#sect_A.52) and did not provide additional information are removed for consistency and clarity.
In addition to ensuring files are NEMA compliant, further processing in the following were done to ensure consistency across the files:
