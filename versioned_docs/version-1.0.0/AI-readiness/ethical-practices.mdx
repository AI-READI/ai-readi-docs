title: Ethical practices
---

The Bridge2AI program aspires to create four datasets that are ethically sourced. The Bridge2AI Center is working to define and characterize what “ethically source” means with respect to the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies applied to health data. In the meantime, AI READI and other grand challenge programs apply accepted regulatory practices including, for example, the involvement of an institutional review board to evaluate compliance with human research protections. In addition, a license has been developed to state the terms of use for those accessing the data available to the public. For data that are deemed more sensitive, a data use agreement will be negotiated.
