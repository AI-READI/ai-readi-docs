## Marker Paper

Our project team has written a marker paper describing AI-READI titled **AI-READI: Rethinking Data Collection, Preparation, and Sharing for Propelling AI-based Discoveries in Diabetes Research and Beyond**. In this paper, we describe the rationale for the study and its emphasis on establishing standards, best practices, and guidelines for collection, preparation, and sharing of data. We introduce the AI-READI project, offer an overview of the anticipated dataset, provide preliminary insights into our methods for collecting and sharing AI-ready datasets, and outline our approach for training a diverse AI workforce.

The marker paper is currently undergoing peer review but will be shared here when accepted and available for wider dissemination.

## Other publications/presentations from the project

We are pleased to present several abstracts concerning work from AI-READI at the upcoming 2024 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Annual Meeting.
